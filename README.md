# App_Reviews

This is my submission for the project [***The Android App Market on Google Play***](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/619) on Datacamp.

In this project we try to analyze customer behavior towards apps on google play, i.e. ratings, downloads, sentiment, etc..<br>
based on whether an app is free or paid, category, size, etc.

**Note**: Plotly visualizations might not be compatible with viewing on github, but luckily you can see it [Here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/KhaledBasiony/App_Reviews/blob/main/notebook.ipynb).
